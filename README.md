# Minecraft Clone
This is a Unity-based Minecraft-style sandbox game developed as a personal learning project. The aim was to explore voxel-based terrain, procedural generation, and core game development concepts using C# and the Unity engine.
## Goals of the project
- **Voxel Systems**: Learned how to implemented a basic voxel engine for terrain representation, simulating a block-based world.
- **Chunk Loading**: Learned to optimize world rendering by dividing the world into manageable sections.
- **UV Mapping**: Learned how to Render blocks using UV coordinates to control how the textures are applied.
- **Optimized rendering**: Parts of blocks that are not visible to the player are not rendered by using custom UV coordinates
